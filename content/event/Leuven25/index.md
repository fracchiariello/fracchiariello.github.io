summary:
abstract: 'Formal Explainable Artificial Intelligence (FXAI) is a growing research area dedicated to providing rigorous explanations for machine learning models. Until now, FXAI approaches have predominantly focused on explaining machine learning classifiers. In this talk, after reviewing key concepts from FXAI for classifiers, we will introduce formal definitions of explanations for the ranking task. We will then present algorithms for computing these explanations, leveraging techniques from combinatorial search and automated reasoning. These contributions have potential applications across various domains, including decision support and recommender systems.'
