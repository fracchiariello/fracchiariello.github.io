abstract: 'We present a tool for compiling three problems from the Process Mining community into Answer Set Programming: Log Generation, Conformance Checking, and Query Checking. For each problem, two versions are addressed, one considering only the control-flow perspective and the other considering also the data perspective. The tool can support companies in analyzing their business processes; it is highly flexible and general, and can be easily modified to address other problems from Declarative Process Mining.'
